# leetcode-multilang

In this repo I will be supplying my answers to leetcode problems in a variety of languages. The purpose of this repo is to grow and retain my skills throughout a plethora of languages used today and to showcase to others the unique approach I took to solving these problems. The answers will be of 100% of my own creation without looking up hints or answers. Thanks for reading.
